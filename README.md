<h2 id="about-me">üîé About me</h2>

Hello, my name is ≈Åukasz Dudek. I am an **IT engineer** with a Master‚Äôs degree from the Cracow University of Technology. Driven by my passion for learning and desire to use my educational background, I found my calling in software testing. This profession allows me to **continuously self-develop** and utilize my curious nature to uncover errors and improve software quality.

To gain **practical experience**, I actively participated in crowdsourced testing on Test.io. This platform enabled me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, where I successfully identified and reported over **80 defects** that got accepted.
This experience honed my **attention to detail**, **analytical thinking**, and commitment to quality assurance.
I worked on various projects, primarily focusing on web applications such as e-commerce shops and booking services, performing various forms of **manual testing** including (**functional**, **exploratory**, regression, retest, UX) on both desktop and mobile devices.


My goal is to expand my testing knowledge, enhance my technical skills, and secure my first job in this dynamic field. Currently learning to write automated tests in **Playwright** using **TypeScript**. I am eager to expand my skills into automation testing to contribute more effectively to software quality assurance.
